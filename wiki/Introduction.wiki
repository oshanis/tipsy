=== What is Tipsy? ===

Tipsy is a project that attempts to provide an easy way to pay people who contribute great things on the web.

=== How does it work? ===

Website creators will embed an XHTML snippet with some RDFa on their web page that specifies some metadata. This include things like the page url, the creator of page, the way they would like to get paid, their PayPal user account.

Users of the tipsy tool, which is currently a firefox extension, will be able to pick a site through a lottery and give back some money to the owner of that site.
