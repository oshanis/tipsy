= A VRM model for more than just collecting donations: how consumers can choose who to pay =

Currently, Website creators can embed an XHTML snippet with some RDFa on their web page that specifies the site url, the creator of page, the way they would like to get paid, and their PayPal user account.  A tipsy browser-side plugin finds these annotations on each page it visits, and records the visit in a log.

In following the Emancipay model, we could provide the vendor and consumer more choice.  Vendors can denote some set of rules they promise to follow in their RDFa snippet, including:
  * Commercial?
  * Display ads?
  * Collect personally-identifiable data?
    * Provide your information to third parties?
    * You own your data?
    * Your data is exportable in a standard format?

Consumers can configure their tipsy clients to only log visits to tipsy-enabled websites with a certain set of rules enabled.  For example, Oshani might only wish to donate to noncommercial entities that will not provide her information to third parties.  Ahmad, on the other hand, might prefer to only pay sites who collect no data, or let him export his data if they do collect it.
